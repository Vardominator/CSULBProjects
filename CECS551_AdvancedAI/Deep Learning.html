    FAQ

  * Can I get a PDF of this book?

    No, our contract with MIT Press forbids distribution of too easily
    copied electronic formats of the book.

  * Why are you using HTML format for the web version of the book?

    This format is a sort of weak DRM required by our contract with MIT
    Press. It's intended to discourage unauthorized copying/editing of
    the book.

  * What is the best way to print the HTML format?

    Printing seems to work best printing directly from the browser,
    using Chrome. Other browsers do not work as well.

  * Can I translate the book into Chinese?

    Posts and Telecom Press has purchased the rights.

If you notice any typos (besides the known issues listed below) or have
suggestions for exercises to add to the website, do not hesitate to
contact any of the authors directly by e-mail: Ian
(<lastname.firstname>@gmail.com), Yoshua
(<firstname>.<lastname>@umontreal.ca), Aaron
(<firstname>.<lastname>@gmail.com). The book itself is now complete and
we are not currently making revisions beyond correcting any minor errors
that remain.

Known issues: In outdated versions of the Edge browser, the "does not
equal" sign sometimes appears as the "equals" sign. This may be resolved
by updating to the latest version.
